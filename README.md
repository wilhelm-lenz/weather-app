# Weather App

In this project, current weather data from several different cities are displayed. First, the weather of the user's correct location is automatically shown. All subsequent locations are permanently integrated. Additionally, a location can be searched for and displayed.

### What We Learned

During the development of this application, we faced various challenges that we had to overcome. In particular, working with git in a team often posed difficulties for us. Additionally, we realized that we lacked a schedule to keep track of time.

### Continued Development

In the next development phase, the focus will be on the weather forecast feature, which has not yet been implemented in this project. Moreover, adherence to best practices will be emphasized to streamline the code in general. The HTML structure will also be revised to improve its semantics, and later, the project will be expanded to include responsiveness.
